== Description ==

Dansnet Meta Tag is a lightweight plugin that allows you to generate HTML metadata to provide information for search engines like Google.

The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable.
Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata.
The metadata can be used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), or other web services.
For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

This plugin supports following tags:

-	"description" defines keywords for search engines
-	"keywords" define a description of your web page
-	"author" defines the author of a page
-	"robots" defines if your web page should be indexed or not

Meta tag settings can be found on the general settings page from your Worpress installation.
